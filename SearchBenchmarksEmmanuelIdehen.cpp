 Search Benchmarks
 Write a program that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a function that
 uses the linear search algorithm to locate one of the values. The function should keep a
 count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. The program then
 should call a function that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It
 should also keep count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on the
 screen.
 
 
 
 Psuedo code:
 
 declare var
 init. array of size
 ask the user for a number and pass the number to the binaray and linear search funtions and do your search
 print result
